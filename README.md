# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many
popular algorithms and data structures.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README
with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones
to YouTube videos).

_‚òù Note that this project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes
only, and it is **not** meant to be used for production._

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

### Algorithms by Paradigm

An algorithmic paradigm is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class
of algorithms. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an
algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.
